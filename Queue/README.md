# Queue Data Structure – From Scratch (C++)

📌 Overview

This project implements a generic Queue data structure 
from scratch using modern C++ templates.

The Queue follows the FIFO principle:

First In → First Out

It is built on top of a custom Doubly Linked List 
to demonstrate composition and abstraction.

---

🎯 Objectives

• Understand FIFO behavior internally  
• Practice template-based generic design  
• Apply composition (Queue built using Linked List)  
• Strengthen pointer manipulation knowledge  
• Write clean and reusable data structures  

---

⚙️ Supported Operations

Push(T item)        → Insert element at end  
Pop()               → Remove element from front  
Front()             → Get first element  
Back()              → Get last element  
Size()              → Return number of elements  
IsEmpty()           → Check if queue is empty  
Print()             → Display elements  

---

🧠 Internal Architecture

Queue is implemented using:

clsDblLinkedList<T>

Mapping:

Push()  → InsertAtEnd()  
Pop()   → DeleteFirstNode()  

This guarantees FIFO ordering.

⏱ Time Complexity (Big O Analysis)

Push      → O(1)  
Pop       → O(1)  
Front     → O(1)  
Back      → O(n)*  
Size      → O(1)  
IsEmpty   → O(1)  

*Back uses index-based access.

▶ Example Usage

clsMyQueue<int> myList;

myList.Push(10);  
myList.Push(20);  
myList.Push(30);  

myList.Print();       // 10 20 30  
myList.Pop();  
myList.Print();       // 20 30
