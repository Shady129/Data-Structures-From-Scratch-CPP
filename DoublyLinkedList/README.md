# Doubly Linked List – C++ Implementation

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a generic Doubly Linked List from scratch using C++ templates and pointers.

The goal is to understand pointer manipulation, dynamic memory management, and bidirectional linking between nodes.

## ⚙️ Features

- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert after node
- Delete first node
- Delete last node
- Delete by value (first occurrence)
- Find node
- Get first item
- Get last item
- Reverse list
- Clear list
- Get size
- Check if empty

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Templates
- Pointers
- Dynamic Memory (new / delete)
- Encapsulation
- Exception Handling
