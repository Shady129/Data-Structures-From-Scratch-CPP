# Doubly Linked List – C++ Implementation

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a generic Doubly Linked List from scratch using C++ templates and pointers.

The goal is to understand pointer manipulation, dynamic memory management, and bidirectional linking between nodes.

## ⚙️ Features

- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert after node
- Delete first node
- Delete last node
- Delete by value (first occurrence)
- Find node
- Get first item
- Get last item
- Reverse list
- Clear list
- Get size
- Check if empty

## ⏱ Time Complexity (Big O Analysis)

| Operation               | Time Complexity |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Insert at beginning      | O(1)            |
| Insert at end            | O(n)            |
| Insert after node        | O(1)            |
| Insert after index       | O(n)            |
| Delete first             | O(1)            |
| Delete last              | O(n)            |
| Delete by value          | O(n)            |
| Find                     | O(n)            |
| Get by index             | O(n)            |
| Update by index          | O(n)            |
| Reverse                  | O(n)            |
| Size                     | O(1)            |
| IsEmpty                  | O(1)            |
